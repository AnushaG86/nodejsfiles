Whitehawk Camp is the remains of a causewayed enclosure, on Whitehawk Hill near Brighton, England. 
Causewayed enclosures are a form of early Neolithic earthwork, characterized by the enclosure of an area with ditches that are interrupted by gaps, or causeways.
 Their purpose is not known. The site consists of four roughly concentric circular ditches; at least two ditches touch the outermost circuit from the outside,
  one of which is thought to date to about two thousand years after the earliest dated activity at the site. 
Whitehawk was first excavated in 1929 and again in the winter of 1932â€“1933. In 1935 the area to be crossed by a new road was excavated. 



In 1991, during the construction of a housing development, a ditch was discovered and excavated.
 In 2011, an analysis of radiocarbon dates concluded that the Neolithic part of the site was probably constructed between 3650 and 3500 BC,
 and probably went out of use some time between 3500 and 3400 BC.
